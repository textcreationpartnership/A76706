            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>VVEE may truly ≈øay with that good King, <hi>This is a day of trouble and of rebuke and bla≈øphemy:</hi> now the accu≈øer of the brethren hath but a ≈øhort time, he rageth again≈øt all that is called God, accu≈øing and impeaching them for that dignity, to be called Gods <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.34, 35. and not onely to men, but they al≈øo a≈øpire to the throne of God, and there accu≈øe the Holy Gho≈øt, as they ≈øay, for a ≈øuppo≈øed Deity: witne≈øs Ma≈øter <hi>Bidle</hi> in his letter to a certain knight, and Member of the Honorable hou≈øe of Commons, where he ≈øeeks to degrade the ble≈ø≈øed Spirit of his God-head, ≈øaying, <hi>He is but one principle ≈øpirit among the Angels, called the Advocate, the holy Spirit, the good Spirit, the Spirit of God by way of eminence,</hi> ≈øee page 2. line 3. ≈øo that it ≈øeems he thinks the holy Gho≈øt to be but one of the created Angels, therefore but a ≈øuppo≈øed Deity: now for thy ≈øatisfaction I ≈øhall lay down ≈øome Scripture Arguments to prove the Deity of the holy gho≈øt, and then briefly An≈øwer his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and fal≈ø Expo≈øition of Scripture, whereby he would prove the contrary.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:111472:3"/>
            <p>Fir≈øt, if the Spirit of God had its being before any creature was made, from all eternity, when there was nothing but God, then it cannot be a created Angel, but God him≈øelf; but all the creatures were made in ≈øix dayes <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.11. And before that any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was formed, while they were without form, the Spirit of God moved upon that deformed Chaos, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. He is called <hi>the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ≈øpirit, Heb.</hi> 9.14 Ergo, the holy gho≈øt is no created Angell but God him≈øelf.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if the ble≈ø≈øed Spirit of God made all the Creatures, it cannot be an Angell or creature it ≈øelf, it mu≈øt needs be God; but in the place before quoted the Spirit of God moved all the creatures to their perfect form, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. <hi>David</hi> ≈øaith of all the creatures, <hi>Thou ≈øendest forth thy ≈øpirit, and they are created,</hi> P≈øal. 104.30. and ≈øaith <hi>Job, The Spirit of God made me, and gave me life,</hi> Job 33.4. and God ≈øaid to the Son, and holy gho≈øt, <hi>let us make man,</hi> ≈øo God created man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26, 27. Ergo, the holy gho≈øt is God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If the Spirit of God rai≈øed up Je≈øus Chri≈øt from the dead, and ≈øhall again quicken our mortall bodies at the la≈øt day, then the holy gho≈øt is God; but the Spirit of God rai≈øed up Je≈øus Chri≈øt from the dead, <hi>&amp; ≈øhal al≈øo quicken our mortall bodies at the last day,</hi> Rom. 8.11. 1 Pet. 3.18. Ergo, the holy gho≈øt is God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if the Spirit of God be omni-pre≈øent in all places, then it cannot be a creature, it mu≈øt needs be God: <hi>But</hi> ≈øaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Whither ≈øhall I go from thy Spirit, if I a≈øcend to heaven, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcend to hell, or flee to the bottome of the Sea, behold thou art there, P≈øal.</hi> 139.7, 8, 9. Ergo, the holy gho≈øt is God.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If it be peculiar to God alone to ≈øearch the heart, and to know the thoughts of men, and yet the holy gho≈øt doth this, then the holy gho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>t is God, but it is peculiar to God to ≈øearch the heart, <hi>I the Lord ≈øearch the heart,</hi> Jer. 17.9.10. <hi>The Lord knows the thoughts of men,</hi> P≈øal. 94.11. Yet the holy gho≈øt doth this, <hi>Thou knowest my thoughts a far off, whither shall I go from thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> P≈øal. 139.2.7. <hi>The day of judgement is hid from all the Angels,</hi> Mat. 24 36. <hi>But the ≈øpirit of God ≈øearcheth and knoweth all the deep things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.10, 11. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Spirit of God is not a created Angell, but is God him≈øelf.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, If all good and perfect gifts come down from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lights, and yet all proceed from the ≈øame Spirit, Then that Spirit is God: but <hi>every good and perfect gift comes down from
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:111472:3"/> the Father of lights,</hi> Jam. 1.17. and yet <hi>all the ≈øeverall gifts come from the ≈øame ≈øpirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.8, <hi>Ergo,</hi> that Spirit is God, that ≈øhall ≈øupply all our need, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.20. and not a creature.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, if the holy gho≈øt hath as great a hand in governing the Church of God, as either the Father or the Son, then the holy gho≈øt is God: but <hi>the Father ≈øends forth labourers into his Vineyard,</hi> Mat. 9.37. and the Son <hi>gave ≈øome Apo≈øtles and ≈øome Prophets and ≈øome Evangelists, and ≈øome Pa≈øtors and Teachers,</hi> Eph. 4.11. <hi>and the holy gho≈øt made them over≈øeers,</hi> Acts 20.28 now it is God that ≈øet all tho≈øe in the Church. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 28. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the holy gho≈øt is God.</p>
            <p>Eightly, If Redemption, Sanctification, and pre≈øervation be ≈øometimes given to the father, and ≈øometimes to the ≈øon, and ≈øometimes to the holy gho≈øt, then the holy gho≈øt is God, as the the father and the ≈øon: but it is ≈øaid that God purcha≈øed his Church. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 74.2. And Je≈øus Chri≈øt bought them. 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 2.1. compared with <hi>Iude</hi> 4. and the holy gho≈øt purcha≈øed them with his blood. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. and ≈øanctified by God the father. <hi>Iude</hi> 1. and ≈øanctified by Je≈øus Chri≈øt. <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 5.26. and ≈øanctified by the holy gho≈øt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.16. ≈øo the Lord keeps his Church, <hi>E≈øa.</hi> 27, 3. And the ≈øon keeps it that none of them are lo≈øt, and the ≈øpirit of God ≈øhal keep them and lead them into al trut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>: therfore the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gho≈øt is God.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, If God wil not give his glory to another, and yet will have all Chri≈øtians baptized as wel in the name of the holy gho≈øt, as in the name of the father and the ≈øon; and if the Apo≈øtle ble≈øs the Church, as wel in the name of the holy gho≈øt, as in the name of the father and the ≈øon, then the holy gho≈øt is God; but God wil not give his glory to another, for ≈øaith he, <hi>there is no God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides me.</hi> I≈øa. 45.5. Yet all Chri≈øtians ≈øhal be baptized in the name of the holy gho≈øt, as wel as in the name of the father and the ≈øon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. And <hi>Paul</hi> ble≈ø≈øed the Chri≈øtians thus, <hi>the grace of our Lord Ie≈øus Chri≈øt, and the love of God, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the holy gho≈øt be with you all Amen.</hi> 2 Cor. 13.14. therfore the holy gho≈øt is God.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, If the ≈øcripture affirm that the father, the word, and the holy gho≈øt, the≈øe three are one, then the holy gho≈øt is God, as the father and the word; but ≈øaith Iohn, <hi>there are three that beare record in heaven, the father, the word, and the holy gho≈øt, and the≈øe three are one, Ergo,</hi> the holy gho≈øt is God.</p>

            <p>I An≈øwer to the two fir≈øt, if there were any truth in them, it would as well take off the Deity of the Son, as of the holy gho≈øt, who is cal'd <hi>the Son of God, and was ≈øent of God, Mat.</hi> 14.33. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. and the la≈øt cleerly proves him to be God. For what creature is able to ≈øearch the depths of an infinite, omnipotent creator, but his own Spirit, which is God, as I have ≈øhewed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10, 11. But then he ≈øaith, <hi>it is impo≈ø≈øible to di≈øtingui≈øh the per≈øon from the e≈ø≈øence of God,</hi> ≈øecondly he ≈øaith, <hi>to distingui≈øh the per≈øon from the e≈ø≈øence of God, were either to make ≈øomething in him finite, or el≈øe two infinites;</hi> thirdly, <hi>to talk of God taken e≈ø≈øentially is ridiculous, for none but a per≈øon can rule others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the≈øe I an≈øwer, we can di≈øtingui≈øh the heat from the light, and both from the body of the ≈øun, and yet all make but one ≈øun; ≈øo we can di≈øtingui≈øh the actions of the ≈øeveral per≈øons of the God-head, as the Father, mu≈øt beget the Son, and not the Son beget the Father, and the Son to be begotten, and the holy gho≈øt to proceed from both, and neither to beget nor be begotten, unle≈øs we ≈øhould not onely deny the Deity of the holy gho≈øt, but al≈øo the Deity of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:111472:4"/> the Father and the Son: and to the ≈øecond I ≈øay, all things in God are infinite, yet this doth not make ≈øo many infinites as he hath At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, nor ≈øo many infinites as per≈øons in Trinity: thirdly, to talk of the e≈ø≈øence of God is not ridiculous; but rather on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it were ridiculous to ≈øay, that onely the heat, or onely the light, or onely the body of the ≈øun were u≈øefull, and not all three joyntly together; ≈øo for God to raign per≈øonally as Father, or as Son, and not all three joyntly and e≈ø≈øentially: but it ≈øeems by this, that although he ≈øaid in the letter, that he would wave his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning the Diety of Chri≈øt, yet he ≈øeems to deny the Deity of Chri≈øt al≈øo, and onely allows of a God as the <hi>Turks</hi> do, out of the Trinity, and out of Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>His ≈øecond Argument; <hi>If he that gave the holy Spirit to the I≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites to instruct them, be alone Jehovah, then the holy Spirit is not Iehovah or God;</hi> but ≈øaith Nehemiah, <hi>Thou art Lord alone, thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve≈øt al≈øo thy good Spirit to in≈øtruct them,</hi> Nehem. 9.6, 20. <hi>Now if he that gave the holy Spirit be Jehovah alone, and the Spirit given be al≈øo Iehovah, it would be a contradiction, therfore the holy Spirit is not Iehovah or God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I An≈øwer, fir≈øt by this Argument he denies the Son as well as the holy gho≈øt, and as the <hi>Turks</hi> allow onely of a God both out of the Trinity and out of Chri≈øt. Secondly, God may give both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf and his Son and his Spirit, and yet not degrade him≈øelf nor his ≈øon, nor his Spirit of their God-head, when he brings man into cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him≈øelf. Thirdly, although it be ≈øaid, <hi>thou art God alone;</hi> yet this is to be under≈øtood in the Unity of the Trinity, and though the Father be Lord, the Son Lord &amp; the holy gho≈øt be Lord, yet not three Lords but one Lord: as I ≈øaid before, the heat is the ≈øun, and the light is the ≈øun, and the body is the ≈øun, and yet not three ≈øuns but one ≈øun; and although all three be equal, yet equalls may one ≈øend another by con≈øent, and yet not degrade him of his Deity, then notwith≈øtanding this Argument, the holy gho≈øt is God.</p>
            <p>His third Argument, <hi>He that ≈øpeaketh not of him≈øelf is not God, but when the ≈øpirit of truth is come, he ≈øhall not ≈øpeak of him≈øelf, But what≈øoever he shall hear that he ≈øhall ≈øpeak,</hi> John 16.13.</p>
            <p>I An≈øwer as before, in this he denies the God-head of the Son, as well as the God-head of the holy gho≈øt, <hi>for he came not to do his own will, but the will of him that ≈øent him,</hi> John 5, 30. <hi>Not to be ministred unto, but to mini≈øter,</hi> Mat. 20.28. <hi>And to do his Fathers
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:111472:5"/> bu≈øine≈øs,</hi> Luk. 2.49. he ≈øaith <hi>not my wil but thy wil be done</hi> Mat. 26 39. <hi>yet this word was God,</hi> Joh. 1.1. For although the Spirit ≈øpeak not from it ≈øelf, yet this doth not degrade him of his Deity, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>on</hi> the contrary, this ≈øhews it to be God in the Unity of the Trinity: which if they were divided, then indeed he could not be God; although this man without ground or ≈øcripture, affirms the contrary; then although he ≈øaid he would not ≈øhew his judgment touching the Godhead of the Son yet plainly denies it al≈øo from many texts, becau≈øe he was ≈øent likewi≈øe not to do his own wil but, his that ≈øent him, <hi>John</hi> 5.19.30. <hi>c.</hi> 7.16.28. <hi>c.</hi> 8.28.42.12.49.50.14.10.24.</p>
            <p>His fourth Argument, <hi>He that heareth from another what he ≈øhal ≈øpeak is not God, the holy Spirit doth ≈øo;</hi> Ergo, <hi>it is not God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I an≈øw. as before, in this he denies the Deity of the Son, who ≈øaith, mine ears ha≈øt thou opened <hi>P≈øa.</hi> 40.6. and he ≈øeems to pre≈øs it from <hi>John</hi> 8.26.28. the truth is, he that denies the Deity of one, wil be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrained to deny the Godhead of the other; although he dares not ≈øhew his judgment touching the Deity of Chri≈øt, till he ≈øee how people will take his bla≈øphemy, to deny the Deity of the Holy Gho≈øt: but one thing in this Argument is remarkable, to ≈øhew the wilful blindne≈øs of this man; and that is by comparing two texts together <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 40.13, 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33.34. in the latter the Apo≈øtle admires at the wi≈ødom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God, ≈øaying, <hi>his ways and judgments are un≈øearchable, and pa≈øt finding out:</hi> the other place ≈øaith as much of the Spirit of the Lord, ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>who taught him judgment or knowledg or the way of under≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> Hence I gather two things: fir≈øt, what is ≈øaid of God in one place is ≈øaid of the Spirit in the other, <hi>ergo,</hi> the Spirit is God; and if all creatures are excluded as unable to ≈øearch out Gods wi≈ødom and knowledg, and yet the Spirit of God can without teaching, then the Spirit of God is God. Then he ≈øaith without proof, that Chri≈øt taught the Spirit as a King doth an Emba≈ø≈øador; but I ≈øay again with <hi>Paul:</hi> Gods ways of wi≈ødom and knowledg are un≈øearchable and pa≈øt finding out of all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and creatures: although he is plea≈øed to ≈øay, the Spirit of God is but an <hi>Angel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His fifth Argument, <hi>He that receiveth of another is not God, but the Spirit doth ≈øo</hi> Ergo, <hi>it is not God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I an≈øw. as before; if there were any truth in this argument, it would prove that Chri≈øt was not God, as ≈øoon as the Holy Gho≈øt; and be≈øides none hath taught the Spirit of God; debated in an≈øwer to his la≈øt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from <hi>I≈øa,</hi> 40.13, 14.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:111472:5"/>
            <p>His ≈øixth argument, <hi>He that is ≈øent by another is not God; the holy Spirit is ≈øent by another,</hi> Ergo <hi>it is not GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to this al≈øo I have an≈øwered, that it denies the Godhead of Chri≈øt as wel as the Godhead of the Holy Gho≈øt, and that equals may one ≈øend another, and that this could neither degrade the Godhead of the Son or of the Holy Gho≈øt.</p>
            <p>His ≈øeventh argument; <hi>He that is the gift of GOD is not GOD; but the holy Spirit is the gift of GOD:</hi> Act. 11.17. <hi>therefore not GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I an≈ø. That gift there ≈øpoken of, is but the operation of God or the work of Gods Spirit in the ≈øoul; <hi>how much more ≈øhal your heavenly Father give his Spirit to them that ask him;</hi> Luk. 11.13. that is, <hi>your Father which is in heaven will give good things to them that aske him;</hi> Mat. 7.11. but the Spirit of God cannot be things in the plural number; unle≈øs they ≈øhould affirm that God would give many Spirits nor is the per≈øon of that one ≈øpirit where it was not before, when as it fils all places; nor as an angel: for then if one had that angel or creature, others mu≈øt be without him at the ≈øame time: ≈øo then the holy Gho≈øt who can work and create and give gifts in many places, and to many per≈øons at once, is God.</p>
            <p>His 8. argument <hi>He that changeth place is not GOD: but the holy Spirit changeth place: he came upon Chri≈øt in a bodily ≈øhape</hi> Luk. 3.21, 32. <hi>therefore it is not GOD.</hi> I an≈ø. God hath often manife≈øted his pre≈øence Exod. 24.10. the Lord ≈øaid, <hi>I wil ≈øend mine Angel, this grieved them:</hi> then ≈øaid the Lord, <hi>my pre≈øence ≈øhal go with thee</hi> Exod. 23.2, 4, 14, then the Spirit of God is God notwith≈øtanding this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
            <p>His Ninth argument: <hi>He that prayeth unto Chri≈øt to come to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not GOD: the holy Spirit doth ≈øo</hi> Rev, 22.17, Ergo <hi>it is not God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I an≈ø. the ≈øpirit there is not ≈øaid to be Gods Spirit, but the Spirit of the bride: but he ≈øaith: <hi>we have received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry Abba Father:</hi> Rom. 8.15. it is true the Spirit of God moveth the ≈øpirit of the bride to cry &amp; to ≈øay, come from: for the Holy gho≈øt moveth all things and yet it ≈øelf is not moved, therefore it is God and no created Angel.</p>
            <p>His tenth argument: <hi>He in whom men have not beleeved and yet have been di≈øciples is not GOD: but men have not ≈øo much as heard whether there were any holy Gho≈øt, yet have been Di≈øciples and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers</hi> Act. 19.2. <hi>therefore the Holy Gho≈øt is not God.</hi> I an≈ø. they might be beleevers and di≈øciples and yet not hear nor know whether
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:111472:6"/> there were any holy Gho≈øt: for the Apo≈øtles them≈øelves who had true grace in their ≈øouls were ignorant both of the death and re≈øurrection a≈ø≈øcen≈øion and coming of Chri≈øt to Judgment: although Chri≈øt had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten told them of it: then mu≈øt we either exclude the≈øe from being di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and beleevers, or el≈øe degrade the holy Gho≈øt of his Godhead. what horrible divinity is this? Again, many a dear child of God may have the Holy Gho≈øt given to him, whether it be taken to be God him≈øelf in Covenant, or the graces of God infu≈øed: the be≈øt of us ≈øee but darkly, and ≈øometimes tho≈øe that fear the Lord walk in darkne≈øs and ≈øee no light <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 50.10. the Holy gho≈øt is GOD, although we had none of us all ever heard of him.</p>
            <p>His eleventh argument: He that hath an under≈øtanding di≈øtinct from that of God is not God: the holy Spirit hath an under≈øtanding di≈øtinct from God: <hi>When the Spirit of truth is come, he ≈øhal not ≈øpeak of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, but whatever he ≈øhal hear that he ≈øhal ≈øpeak</hi> Joh, 16 13. he ≈øhal glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rifie me, for he ≈øhal receive of mine &amp; take of mine and ≈øhew it you v. 14.15. <hi>Ergo</hi> the holy gho≈øt is not God. I an≈ø. that which the Son re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives of the Father, and the holy Gho≈øt of both, the father and the ≈øon, doth not degrade either Son or holy Gho≈øt of their Godhead: for the Father is the fountain of all actions: the Son the worker, and the holy Gho≈øt the fini≈øher: or thus; the Father works, by the Son, through the holy gho≈øt; the Son works from the Father by the holy gho≈øt: the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gho≈øt works both from the Father and the Son: as di≈øtinct ≈øub≈øi≈øtances in the ≈øame Godhead.</p>
            <p>His twelfth Argument; <hi>He that hath a wil di≈øtinct in number from God is not God, the ≈øpirit hath a wil di≈øtinct in number from God, therefore the ≈øpirit is not God.</hi> Here I might ≈øhew how this man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys the diety of Chri≈øt, who ≈øaith, <hi>not my wil, but thy wil be done,</hi> Mat. 26. But let us ≈øee his proof, how the ≈øpirit hath a wil di≈øtinct in number from God, and that is from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.27. the ≈øpirit hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth our infirmities, for we know not for what to pray as we ought: but the ≈øpirit him≈øelf maketh interce≈ø≈øion for us with ≈øighs and groans unutterable: but he that ≈øearcheth the heart, and knows the mind of the ≈øpirit, maketh interce≈ø≈øion for the Saints according to the wil of God; here ≈øaith he is an impregnable argument, of the ≈øpirits being inferior to God, becau≈øe he maketh interce≈ø≈øion: and tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, or according to the wil of God, therefore the ≈øpirit is not God.</p>
            <p>I an≈øwer, It is true the ≈øpirit of God inditeth, frameth or maketh interce≈ø≈øion for us, and we take up tho≈øe words and turn to the Lord,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:111472:6"/> 
               <hi>Ho≈øea</hi> 14.2. but wil it follow, becau≈øe the ≈øpirit inditeth our prayers, and ≈øo teacheth us to pray according to the wil of God, that therefore the ≈øpirit maketh interce≈ø≈øion? no, it is the ≈øpirit that inditeth or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth our reque≈øts according to the wil of God, but it is Chri≈øt our only mediator that pre≈øents our Petitions to the father, and ≈øo they are accepted as from the hand of Chri≈øt, <hi>Revel.</hi> 8.3. Then the holy Gho≈øt doth not make interce≈ø≈øion to God for us, that is the work of Chri≈øt, only he indites our reque≈øts in us and for us: and while this man affirms that the holy Gho≈øt is but an Angel, and yet an advocate to make interce≈ø≈øion for us, in this he agreeth with Papi≈øts, who make Angels their advocates, <hi>whereas God chargeth them with folly,</hi> Job 4.18. <hi>They cover their faces an their feet, becau≈øe they are a≈øham<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But the truth is, no Saint or Angel can make Interce≈ø≈øion for us, they know not our want, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 63.16.

Although they ≈øtoop down and de≈øire to look into it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. But here is one thing in this text that might ≈øatisfy this man, the holy Gho≈øt is God, if he were not wilfully blinded; mark, he that ≈øearcheth the heart and knows the mind of the ≈øpirit, who is that? The heart is deceitful above the reach of all things or creatures, <hi>Ergo,</hi> no Angel can know it, then who can know it? an≈øwer is made, <hi>I the Lord ≈øearch the heart.</hi> Jer. 17.9, 10. Then I may ≈øay with him that was re≈øtored to his ≈øight, this is a mervielous thing that ye know not who it is, and yet he ≈øearcheth the heart, and knows the mind of the ≈øpirit: Then I ≈øay the Lord is that ≈øpirit, and where the ≈øpirit of the Lord is, there is liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. Then if the ≈øpirit ≈øearch the heart, and the Lord is that ≈øpirit, then it is clear that the holy Gho≈øt is God, and ≈øo his Imprognable Argument is demoli≈øhed and not able to defend his bla≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy again≈øt the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now I ≈øhal briefly an≈øwer his fal≈øe expo≈øition of ≈øome texts of Scripture: I begin with <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19: this text he would corrupt thus, ≈øaying, to be baptized in the name of the holy Gho≈øt, is no more but to be baptized unto the guidance of the ≈øpirit, or Angel to guide them, as the <hi>Jews</hi> are ≈øaid to be baptized unto <hi>Mo≈øes.</hi> 1 Cor. 10.2. which place he corrupts al≈øo, ≈øaying, they were baptized into <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes,</hi> but he that is baptized into Chri≈øt hath put on Chri≈øt by profe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, he is a Chri≈øtian, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. As when <hi>Jo≈øephs</hi> ≈øons took upon them, <hi>I≈øraels</hi> name, they were called <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> Gen. 48.16. Then becau≈øe <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaith, there is but one God and one Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and no man ≈øpeaking by the ≈øpirit of God, calleth Je≈øus accur≈øed, neither can they ≈øay that Je≈øus is the Lord but by the holy Gho≈øt. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5, 6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3, And there is one body and one ≈øpirit, one God and father of all. <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 4.3, 4, 5, 6. From the≈øe places he would degrad the holy Gho≈øt of his Godhead, when as, if but one ≈øpirit act all the my≈øtical body of Chri≈øt, it mu≈øt needs be God; for how ≈øhould a creature act all the Saints in heaven and earth, all are joyned to the Lord by one ≈øpirit. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. Now by this ≈øpirit none can cur≈øe Je≈øus Chri≈øt, nor can any truly ≈øay Chri≈øt is their Lord, but by this ≈øpirit of God, who only makes them obedient to father ≈øon and holy Gho≈øt, for the≈øe three are one, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7. But let us a little view his expo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that text, who ≈øaith the father, word, and holy Gho≈øt are one by agreement only; but have we not all one father, hath not one God created us, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.10?
