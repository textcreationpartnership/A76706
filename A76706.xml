            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>VVEE may truly ſay with that good King, <hi>This is a day of trouble and of rebuke and blaſphemy:</hi> now the accuſer of the brethren hath but a ſhort time, he rageth againſt all that is called God, accuſing and impeaching them for that dignity, to be called Gods <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.34, 35. and not onely to men, but they alſo aſpire to the throne of God, and there accuſe the Holy Ghoſt, as they ſay, for a ſuppoſed Deity: witneſs Maſter <hi>Bidle</hi> in his letter to a certain knight, and Member of the Honorable houſe of Commons, where he ſeeks to degrade the bleſſed Spirit of his God-head, ſaying, <hi>He is but one principle ſpirit among the Angels, called the Advocate, the holy Spirit, the good Spirit, the Spirit of God by way of eminence,</hi> ſee page 2. line 3. ſo that it ſeems he thinks the holy Ghoſt to be but one of the created Angels, therefore but a ſuppoſed Deity: now for thy ſatisfaction I ſhall lay down ſome Scripture Arguments to prove the Deity of the holy ghoſt, and then briefly Anſwer his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and falſ Expoſition of Scripture, whereby he would prove the contrary.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:111472:3"/>
            <p>Firſt, if the Spirit of God had its being before any creature was made, from all eternity, when there was nothing but God, then it cannot be a created Angel, but God himſelf; but all the creatures were made in ſix dayes <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.11. And before that any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was formed, while they were without form, the Spirit of God moved upon that deformed Chaos, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. He is called <hi>the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſpirit, Heb.</hi> 9.14 Ergo, the holy ghoſt is no created Angell but God himſelf.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if the bleſſed Spirit of God made all the Creatures, it cannot be an Angell or creature it ſelf, it muſt needs be God; but in the place before quoted the Spirit of God moved all the creatures to their perfect form, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. <hi>David</hi> ſaith of all the creatures, <hi>Thou ſendest forth thy ſpirit, and they are created,</hi> Pſal. 104.30. and ſaith <hi>Job, The Spirit of God made me, and gave me life,</hi> Job 33.4. and God ſaid to the Son, and holy ghoſt, <hi>let us make man,</hi> ſo God created man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26, 27. Ergo, the holy ghoſt is God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If the Spirit of God raiſed up Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, and ſhall again quicken our mortall bodies at the laſt day, then the holy ghoſt is God; but the Spirit of God raiſed up Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, <hi>&amp; ſhal alſo quicken our mortall bodies at the last day,</hi> Rom. 8.11. 1 Pet. 3.18. Ergo, the holy ghoſt is God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if the Spirit of God be omni-preſent in all places, then it cannot be a creature, it muſt needs be God: <hi>But</hi> ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Whither ſhall I go from thy Spirit, if I aſcend to heaven, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to hell, or flee to the bottome of the Sea, behold thou art there, Pſal.</hi> 139.7, 8, 9. Ergo, the holy ghoſt is God.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If it be peculiar to God alone to ſearch the heart, and to know the thoughts of men, and yet the holy ghoſt doth this, then the holy gho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t is God, but it is peculiar to God to ſearch the heart, <hi>I the Lord ſearch the heart,</hi> Jer. 17.9.10. <hi>The Lord knows the thoughts of men,</hi> Pſal. 94.11. Yet the holy ghoſt doth this, <hi>Thou knowest my thoughts a far off, whither shall I go from thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> Pſal. 139.2.7. <hi>The day of judgement is hid from all the Angels,</hi> Mat. 24 36. <hi>But the ſpirit of God ſearcheth and knoweth all the deep things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.10, 11. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Spirit of God is not a created Angell, but is God himſelf.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, If all good and perfect gifts come down from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lights, and yet all proceed from the ſame Spirit, Then that Spirit is God: but <hi>every good and perfect gift comes down from
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:111472:3"/> the Father of lights,</hi> Jam. 1.17. and yet <hi>all the ſeverall gifts come from the ſame ſpirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.8, <hi>Ergo,</hi> that Spirit is God, that ſhall ſupply all our need, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.20. and not a creature.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, if the holy ghoſt hath as great a hand in governing the Church of God, as either the Father or the Son, then the holy ghoſt is God: but <hi>the Father ſends forth labourers into his Vineyard,</hi> Mat. 9.37. and the Son <hi>gave ſome Apoſtles and ſome Prophets and ſome Evangelists, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> Eph. 4.11. <hi>and the holy ghoſt made them overſeers,</hi> Acts 20.28 now it is God that ſet all thoſe in the Church. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 28. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the holy ghoſt is God.</p>
            <p>Eightly, If Redemption, Sanctification, and preſervation be ſometimes given to the father, and ſometimes to the ſon, and ſometimes to the holy ghoſt, then the holy ghoſt is God, as the the father and the ſon: but it is ſaid that God purchaſed his Church. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.2. And Jeſus Chriſt bought them. 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 2.1. compared with <hi>Iude</hi> 4. and the holy ghoſt purchaſed them with his blood. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. and ſanctified by God the father. <hi>Iude</hi> 1. and ſanctified by Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.26. and ſanctified by the holy ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.16. ſo the Lord keeps his Church, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 27, 3. And the ſon keeps it that none of them are loſt, and the ſpirit of God ſhal keep them and lead them into al trut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: therfore the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt is God.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, If God wil not give his glory to another, and yet will have all Chriſtians baptized as wel in the name of the holy ghoſt, as in the name of the father and the ſon; and if the Apoſtle bleſs the Church, as wel in the name of the holy ghoſt, as in the name of the father and the ſon, then the holy ghoſt is God; but God wil not give his glory to another, for ſaith he, <hi>there is no God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides me.</hi> Iſa. 45.5. Yet all Chriſtians ſhal be baptized in the name of the holy ghoſt, as wel as in the name of the father and the ſon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. And <hi>Paul</hi> bleſſed the Chriſtians thus, <hi>the grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and the love of God, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the holy ghoſt be with you all Amen.</hi> 2 Cor. 13.14. therfore the holy ghoſt is God.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, If the ſcripture affirm that the father, the word, and the holy ghoſt, theſe three are one, then the holy ghoſt is God, as the father and the word; but ſaith Iohn, <hi>there are three that beare record in heaven, the father, the word, and the holy ghoſt, and theſe three are one, Ergo,</hi> the holy ghoſt is God.</p>
            <p n="11">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:111472:4"/>11. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thus ſaith the holy Ghoſt, if ye wil hear his voyce:</hi> and <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>For he is the Lord our God, and we are his people, harden not your hearts,</hi> Heb. 3.7. Pſal. 95.7. and ſaith <hi>Peter, Holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.21. Acts 28.25. and ſaith <hi>Luke, It was the Lord God of Iſrael, that ſpake by the mouth of all his Prophets, ſince the world began,</hi> Luke 1.68, 70. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the holy ghoſt is the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. Laſtly, becauſe I will not exceed his number of Arguments; if when <hi>Ananias</hi> lyed to the holy ghoſt, he is ſaid to lye unto God, then the holy ghoſt is God; <hi>But,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lye to the holy ghoſt? thou haſt not lyed unto men, but unto God;</hi> Acts 5.3, 4. Ergo, the holy ghoſt is God: and now I ſhall briefly Anſwer Mr <hi>Bidles</hi> twelve Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by which he would prove the contrary.</p>

            <p>I Anſwer to the two firſt, if there were any truth in them, it would as well take off the Deity of the Son, as of the holy ghoſt, who is cal'd <hi>the Son of God, and was ſent of God, Mat.</hi> 14.33. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. and the laſt cleerly proves him to be God. For what creature is able to ſearch the depths of an infinite, omnipotent creator, but his own Spirit, which is God, as I have ſhewed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10, 11. But then he ſaith, <hi>it is impoſſible to diſtinguiſh the perſon from the eſſence of God,</hi> ſecondly he ſaith, <hi>to distinguiſh the perſon from the eſſence of God, were either to make ſomething in him finite, or elſe two infinites;</hi> thirdly, <hi>to talk of God taken eſſentially is ridiculous, for none but a perſon can rule others.</hi>

            <p>To theſe I anſwer, we can diſtinguiſh the heat from the light, and both from the body of the ſun, and yet all make but one ſun; ſo we can diſtinguiſh the actions of the ſeveral perſons of the God-head, as the Father, muſt beget the Son, and not the Son beget the Father, and the Son to be begotten, and the holy ghoſt to proceed from both, and neither to beget nor be begotten, unleſs we ſhould not onely deny the Deity of the holy ghoſt, but alſo the Deity of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:111472:4"/> the Father and the Son: and to the ſecond I ſay, all things in God are infinite, yet this doth not make ſo many infinites as he hath At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, nor ſo many infinites as perſons in Trinity: thirdly, to talk of the eſſence of God is not ridiculous; but rather on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it were ridiculous to ſay, that onely the heat, or onely the light, or onely the body of the ſun were uſefull, and not all three joyntly together; ſo for God to raign perſonally as Father, or as Son, and not all three joyntly and eſſentially: but it ſeems by this, that although he ſaid in the letter, that he would wave his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning the Diety of Chriſt, yet he ſeems to deny the Deity of Chriſt alſo, and onely allows of a God as the <hi>Turks</hi> do, out of the Trinity, and out of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>His ſecond Argument; <hi>If he that gave the holy Spirit to the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites to instruct them, be alone Jehovah, then the holy Spirit is not Iehovah or God;</hi> but ſaith Nehemiah, <hi>Thou art Lord alone, thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt alſo thy good Spirit to inſtruct them,</hi> Nehem. 9.6, 20. <hi>Now if he that gave the holy Spirit be Jehovah alone, and the Spirit given be alſo Iehovah, it would be a contradiction, therfore the holy Spirit is not Iehovah or God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, firſt by this Argument he denies the Son as well as the holy ghoſt, and as the <hi>Turks</hi> allow onely of a God both out of the Trinity and out of Chriſt. Secondly, God may give both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Son and his Spirit, and yet not degrade himſelf nor his ſon, nor his Spirit of their God-head, when he brings man into cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with himſelf. Thirdly, although it be ſaid, <hi>thou art God alone;</hi> yet this is to be underſtood in the Unity of the Trinity, and though the Father be Lord, the Son Lord &amp; the holy ghoſt be Lord, yet not three Lords but one Lord: as I ſaid before, the heat is the ſun, and the light is the ſun, and the body is the ſun, and yet not three ſuns but one ſun; and although all three be equal, yet equalls may one ſend another by conſent, and yet not degrade him of his Deity, then notwithſtanding this Argument, the holy ghoſt is God.</p>
            <p>His third Argument, <hi>He that ſpeaketh not of himſelf is not God, but when the ſpirit of truth is come, he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf, But whatſoever he shall hear that he ſhall ſpeak,</hi> John 16.13.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer as before, in this he denies the God-head of the Son, as well as the God-head of the holy ghoſt, <hi>for he came not to do his own will, but the will of him that ſent him,</hi> John 5, 30. <hi>Not to be ministred unto, but to miniſter,</hi> Mat. 20.28. <hi>And to do his Fathers
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:111472:5"/> buſineſs,</hi> Luk. 2.49. he ſaith <hi>not my wil but thy wil be done</hi> Mat. 26 39. <hi>yet this word was God,</hi> Joh. 1.1. For although the Spirit ſpeak not from it ſelf, yet this doth not degrade him of his Deity, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>on</hi> the contrary, this ſhews it to be God in the Unity of the Trinity: which if they were divided, then indeed he could not be God; although this man without ground or ſcripture, affirms the contrary; then although he ſaid he would not ſhew his judgment touching the Godhead of the Son yet plainly denies it alſo from many texts, becauſe he was ſent likewiſe not to do his own wil but, his that ſent him, <hi>John</hi> 5.19.30. <hi>c.</hi> 7.16.28. <hi>c.</hi> 8.28.42.12.49.50.14.10.24.</p>
            <p>His fourth Argument, <hi>He that heareth from another what he ſhal ſpeak is not God, the holy Spirit doth ſo;</hi> Ergo, <hi>it is not God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſw. as before, in this he denies the Deity of the Son, who ſaith, mine ears haſt thou opened <hi>Pſa.</hi> 40.6. and he ſeems to preſs it from <hi>John</hi> 8.26.28. the truth is, he that denies the Deity of one, wil be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to deny the Godhead of the other; although he dares not ſhew his judgment touching the Deity of Chriſt, till he ſee how people will take his blaſphemy, to deny the Deity of the Holy Ghoſt: but one thing in this Argument is remarkable, to ſhew the wilful blindneſs of this man; and that is by comparing two texts together <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.13, 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33.34. in the latter the Apoſtle admires at the wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God, ſaying, <hi>his ways and judgments are unſearchable, and paſt finding out:</hi> the other place ſaith as much of the Spirit of the Lord, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>who taught him judgment or knowledg or the way of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> Hence I gather two things: firſt, what is ſaid of God in one place is ſaid of the Spirit in the other, <hi>ergo,</hi> the Spirit is God; and if all creatures are excluded as unable to ſearch out Gods wiſdom and knowledg, and yet the Spirit of God can without teaching, then the Spirit of God is God. Then he ſaith without proof, that Chriſt taught the Spirit as a King doth an Embaſſador; but I ſay again with <hi>Paul:</hi> Gods ways of wiſdom and knowledg are unſearchable and paſt finding out of all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and creatures: although he is pleaſed to ſay, the Spirit of God is but an <hi>Angel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His fifth Argument, <hi>He that receiveth of another is not God, but the Spirit doth ſo</hi> Ergo, <hi>it is not God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſw. as before; if there were any truth in this argument, it would prove that Chriſt was not God, as ſoon as the Holy Ghoſt; and beſides none hath taught the Spirit of God; debated in anſwer to his laſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from <hi>Iſa,</hi> 40.13, 14.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:111472:5"/>
            <p>His ſixth argument, <hi>He that is ſent by another is not God; the holy Spirit is ſent by another,</hi> Ergo <hi>it is not GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to this alſo I have anſwered, that it denies the Godhead of Chriſt as wel as the Godhead of the Holy Ghoſt, and that equals may one ſend another, and that this could neither degrade the Godhead of the Son or of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>His ſeventh argument; <hi>He that is the gift of GOD is not GOD; but the holy Spirit is the gift of GOD:</hi> Act. 11.17. <hi>therefore not GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſ. That gift there ſpoken of, is but the operation of God or the work of Gods Spirit in the ſoul; <hi>how much more ſhal your heavenly Father give his Spirit to them that ask him;</hi> Luk. 11.13. that is, <hi>your Father which is in heaven will give good things to them that aske him;</hi> Mat. 7.11. but the Spirit of God cannot be things in the plural number; unleſs they ſhould affirm that God would give many Spirits nor is the perſon of that one ſpirit where it was not before, when as it fils all places; nor as an angel: for then if one had that angel or creature, others muſt be without him at the ſame time: ſo then the holy Ghoſt who can work and create and give gifts in many places, and to many perſons at once, is God.</p>
            <p>His 8. argument <hi>He that changeth place is not GOD: but the holy Spirit changeth place: he came upon Chriſt in a bodily ſhape</hi> Luk. 3.21, 32. <hi>therefore it is not GOD.</hi> I anſ. God hath often manifeſted his preſence Exod. 24.10. the Lord ſaid, <hi>I wil ſend mine Angel, this grieved them:</hi> then ſaid the Lord, <hi>my preſence ſhal go with thee</hi> Exod. 23.2, 4, 14, then the Spirit of God is God notwithſtanding this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
            <p>His Ninth argument: <hi>He that prayeth unto Chriſt to come to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not GOD: the holy Spirit doth ſo</hi> Rev, 22.17, Ergo <hi>it is not God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſ. the ſpirit there is not ſaid to be Gods Spirit, but the Spirit of the bride: but he ſaith: <hi>we have received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry Abba Father:</hi> Rom. 8.15. it is true the Spirit of God moveth the ſpirit of the bride to cry &amp; to ſay, come from: for the Holy ghoſt moveth all things and yet it ſelf is not moved, therefore it is God and no created Angel.</p>
            <p>His tenth argument: <hi>He in whom men have not beleeved and yet have been diſciples is not GOD: but men have not ſo much as heard whether there were any holy Ghoſt, yet have been Diſciples and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers</hi> Act. 19.2. <hi>therefore the Holy Ghoſt is not God.</hi> I anſ. they might be beleevers and diſciples and yet not hear nor know whether
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:111472:6"/> there were any holy Ghoſt: for the Apoſtles themſelves who had true grace in their ſouls were ignorant both of the death and reſurrection aſſcenſion and coming of Chriſt to Judgment: although Chriſt had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten told them of it: then muſt we either exclude theſe from being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and beleevers, or elſe degrade the holy Ghoſt of his Godhead. what horrible divinity is this? Again, many a dear child of God may have the Holy Ghoſt given to him, whether it be taken to be God himſelf in Covenant, or the graces of God infuſed: the beſt of us ſee but darkly, and ſometimes thoſe that fear the Lord walk in darkneſs and ſee no light <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. the Holy ghoſt is GOD, although we had none of us all ever heard of him.</p>
            <p>His eleventh argument: He that hath an underſtanding diſtinct from that of God is not God: the holy Spirit hath an underſtanding diſtinct from God: <hi>When the Spirit of truth is come, he ſhal not ſpeak of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but whatever he ſhal hear that he ſhal ſpeak</hi> Joh, 16 13. he ſhal glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rifie me, for he ſhal receive of mine &amp; take of mine and ſhew it you v. 14.15. <hi>Ergo</hi> the holy ghoſt is not God. I anſ. that which the Son re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives of the Father, and the holy Ghoſt of both, the father and the ſon, doth not degrade either Son or holy Ghoſt of their Godhead: for the Father is the fountain of all actions: the Son the worker, and the holy Ghoſt the finiſher: or thus; the Father works, by the Son, through the holy ghoſt; the Son works from the Father by the holy ghoſt: the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt works both from the Father and the Son: as diſtinct ſubſiſtances in the ſame Godhead.</p>
            <p>His twelfth Argument; <hi>He that hath a wil diſtinct in number from God is not God, the ſpirit hath a wil diſtinct in number from God, therefore the ſpirit is not God.</hi> Here I might ſhew how this man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys the diety of Chriſt, who ſaith, <hi>not my wil, but thy wil be done,</hi> Mat. 26. But let us ſee his proof, how the ſpirit hath a wil diſtinct in number from God, and that is from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.27. the ſpirit hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth our infirmities, for we know not for what to pray as we ought: but the ſpirit himſelf maketh interceſſion for us with ſighs and groans unutterable: but he that ſearcheth the heart, and knows the mind of the ſpirit, maketh interceſſion for the Saints according to the wil of God; here ſaith he is an impregnable argument, of the ſpirits being inferior to God, becauſe he maketh interceſſion: and tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, or according to the wil of God, therefore the ſpirit is not God.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, It is true the ſpirit of God inditeth, frameth or maketh interceſſion for us, and we take up thoſe words and turn to the Lord,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:111472:6"/> 
               <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14.2. but wil it follow, becauſe the ſpirit inditeth our prayers, and ſo teacheth us to pray according to the wil of God, that therefore the ſpirit maketh interceſſion? no, it is the ſpirit that inditeth or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth our requeſts according to the wil of God, but it is Chriſt our only mediator that preſents our Petitions to the father, and ſo they are accepted as from the hand of Chriſt, <hi>Revel.</hi> 8.3. Then the holy Ghoſt doth not make interceſſion to God for us, that is the work of Chriſt, only he indites our requeſts in us and for us: and while this man affirms that the holy Ghoſt is but an Angel, and yet an advocate to make interceſſion for us, in this he agreeth with Papiſts, who make Angels their advocates, <hi>whereas God chargeth them with folly,</hi> Job 4.18. <hi>They cover their faces an their feet, becauſe they are aſham<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> who there ſaid to the Prophet, <hi>make their eares out of hearing,</hi> Paul ſaith, <hi>it was the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Acts 28.25. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the holy Ghoſt is God, and not an Angel, who durſt not behold his holyneſs, and the ſcripture is plain, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt alone is our Advocate,</hi> 1 John. 2.1. <hi>He ever liveth to make Interceſſion for us.</hi> Heb. 7.25. But the truth is, no Saint or Angel can make Interceſſion for us, they know not our want, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.16. And the Angels know no more about the work of our Redemption, then is made known to them by the Church, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 3.10. Although they ſtoop down and deſire to look into it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. But here is one thing in this text that might ſatisfy this man, the holy Ghoſt is God, if he were not wilfully blinded; mark, he that ſearcheth the heart and knows the mind of the ſpirit, who is that? The heart is deceitful above the reach of all things or creatures, <hi>Ergo,</hi> no Angel can know it, then who can know it? anſwer is made, <hi>I the Lord ſearch the heart.</hi> Jer. 17.9, 10. Then I may ſay with him that was reſtored to his ſight, this is a mervielous thing that ye know not who it is, and yet he ſearcheth the heart, and knows the mind of the ſpirit: Then I ſay the Lord is that ſpirit, and where the ſpirit of the Lord is, there is liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. Then if the ſpirit ſearch the heart, and the Lord is that ſpirit, then it is clear that the holy Ghoſt is God, and ſo his Imprognable Argument is demoliſhed and not able to defend his blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy againſt the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ety of the holy Ghoſt. Again, this Argument is rather fram'd againſt the Godhead of Chriſt becauſe he maketh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he is not God, but inferior to God, but the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>d is God, the ſon that was given is the mighty God, my God and my
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:111472:7"/> Lord, as I have ſhewed. Again, if the ſpirit is not God for making requeſt for us, then the ſon is not God who taught us to pray, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.9. Nor the father who gave us the ſpirit of grace and ſupplication. <hi>Zac.</hi> 12.10. But enough of this.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhal briefly anſwer his falſe expoſition of ſome texts of Scripture: I begin with <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19: this text he would corrupt thus, ſaying, to be baptized in the name of the holy Ghoſt, is no more but to be baptized unto the guidance of the ſpirit, or Angel to guide them, as the <hi>Jews</hi> are ſaid to be baptized unto <hi>Moſes.</hi> 1 Cor. 10.2. which place he corrupts alſo, ſaying, they were baptized into <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> but he that is baptized into Chriſt hath put on Chriſt by profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he is a Chriſtian, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. As when <hi>Joſephs</hi> ſons took upon them, <hi>Iſraels</hi> name, they were called <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Gen. 48.16. Then becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, there is but one God and one Jeſus Chriſt, and no man ſpeaking by the ſpirit of God, calleth Jeſus accurſed, neither can they ſay that Jeſus is the Lord but by the holy Ghoſt. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5, 6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3, And there is one body and one ſpirit, one God and father of all. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.3, 4, 5, 6. From theſe places he would degrad the holy Ghoſt of his Godhead, when as, if but one ſpirit act all the myſtical body of Chriſt, it muſt needs be God; for how ſhould a creature act all the Saints in heaven and earth, all are joyned to the Lord by one ſpirit. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. Now by this ſpirit none can curſe Jeſus Chriſt, nor can any truly ſay Chriſt is their Lord, but by this ſpirit of God, who only makes them obedient to father ſon and holy Ghoſt, for theſe three are one, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7. But let us a little view his expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that text, who ſaith the father, word, and holy Ghoſt are one by agreement only; but have we not all one father, hath not one God created us, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.10? My father and your father is my God and your God <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.17. and the word was God Joh. 1.1. unto us a ſon is given; the mighty <hi>GOD Iſa.</hi> 9.6. Ieſus Chriſt is my <hi>Lord</hi> and my <hi>GOD</hi> Ioh. 20.28. and the Spirit of God is omnipotent; for ſaith <hi>John,</hi> the Spirit worketh where it liſteth, <hi>John</hi> 3.8. a title peculiar to God, who doth whatſoever pleaſeth him <hi>Pſa.</hi> 135.6. ſo he is omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient and omnipreſent, and ſo infinite as the Father and the Son; which could not ſtand with them, if they were only one by agreement: but as I ſaid of the ſun; the heat is the ſun, and the light is the ſun, and the body of it is the ſun; yet not three ſuns but one ſun: ſo the Father is God, the Son is God, the Holy ghoſt is God, yet not three Gods but one God.</p>
